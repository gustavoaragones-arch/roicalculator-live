      <h1>ROI Limitations</h1>

      <p>ROI is a useful metric, but it can mislead when used in the wrong context or when important factors are overlooked. Recognizing these limitations helps you interpret ROI correctly and choose better metrics when needed.</p>

      <h2>Time Value of Money</h2>
      <p>ROI treats all dollars equally regardless of when they occur. A 50% return over one year is far better than a 50% return over twenty years—the former implies strong annual growth; the latter implies weak compound growth. Simple ROI does not distinguish between them. Always use <a href="/learn/how-to-calculate-roi.html">annualized ROI</a> when comparing investments with different holding periods. For investments with multiple cash flows, <a href="/learn/roi-vs-irr.html">IRR</a> or net present value (NPV) are more appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Excluded Costs</h2>
      <p>ROI is often calculated using only purchase price and sale price, omitting transaction fees, management fees, taxes, and opportunity cost. A 20% ROI before fees might be 15% after. In real estate, closing costs, repairs, property management, and vacancies can materially reduce actual returns. For business projects, training, implementation, and maintenance costs are easy to overlook. To avoid inflated ROI, include all relevant costs in the "initial investment" or "total cost" figure. See <a href="/glossary/net-profit.html">net profit</a> for a disciplined treatment of profit.</p>

      <h2>Risk Is Ignored</h2>
      <p>ROI does not account for risk. A 30% ROI on a speculative venture is not equivalent to 30% on a government bond. Two investments with the same ROI can have very different volatility and probability of loss. Risk-adjusted metrics such as the Sharpe ratio (return per unit of risk) or Sortino ratio provide a more complete picture. For high-risk investments, a higher ROI is required to compensate; comparing raw ROI across risk levels can lead to poor decisions.</p>

      <h2>Single Cash Flow Assumption</h2>
      <p>Standard ROI assumes one investment at the start and one value at the end. Many real-world investments involve multiple deposits, withdrawals, dividends, or interest payments. ROI can be adapted (e.g., sum of all outflows as "cost" and sum of all inflows as "return"), but the result is arbitrary when cash flows span different dates. IRR and NPV are designed for multi-period cash flows and properly account for timing.</p>

      <h2>Manipulation and Cherry-Picking</h2>
      <p>ROI can be manipulated by selective definition. Including only favorable costs, excluding taxes, or choosing a flattering time period can make ROI look better than it is. Marketing ROI is particularly susceptible: some definitions count only direct revenue, others include lifetime value; some include only ad spend, others include creative and overhead. When evaluating ROI claims, ask what costs and revenues were included and over what period. Consistency is essential for comparison.</p>

      <h2>No Standard Definition</h2>
      <p>Unlike some accounting metrics, ROI has no universally mandated definition. Industries and firms define it differently. Real estate ROI may or may not include financing costs; marketing ROI may use different attribution models. When comparing ROIs across sources, ensure the definitions align. Our <a href="/methodology.html">Methodology</a> page specifies how we define and calculate ROI on this site.</p>

      <h2>When ROI Is Still Useful</h2>
      <p>Despite these limitations, ROI remains valuable for quick, comparable analysis of simple investments. It is easy to compute and widely understood. Use it as a starting point, but supplement with annualized returns for multi-year holds, IRR for complex cash flows, and risk-adjusted metrics when comparing across risk levels. Our <a href="/">ROI Calculator</a> supports basic and annualized ROI; for more complex scenarios, use appropriate tools.</p>
