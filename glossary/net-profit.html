      <h1>Net Profit</h1>

      <div class="definition-block">
        <p><strong>Net profit</strong> (also net income or bottom line) is the amount of money a business retains after subtracting all expenses from revenue: cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest, taxes, and other items. It is the profit attributable to shareholders and appears at the bottom of the income statement. For investments, net profit is the gain or loss after all costs.</p>
      </div>

      <h2>Formula</h2>
      <p class="math-inline">Net Profit = Revenue − COGS − Operating Expenses − Interest − Taxes − Other Expenses</p>
      <p>Or: Net Profit = Gross Profit − Operating Expenses − Interest − Taxes. For a simple investment: Net Profit = Final Value − Initial Investment − All Costs (fees, taxes, etc.).</p>

      <h2>Example</h2>
      <p>A company has $1M revenue, $400K COGS, $300K operating expenses, $50K interest, and $75K taxes. Gross profit = $600K. Net profit = $600K − $300K − $50K − $75K = $175K. For an investment: buy at $10,000, sell at $12,000, pay $100 in fees. Net profit = $12,000 − $10,000 − $100 = $1,900.</p>

      <h2>Relationship to ROI</h2>
      <p>ROI is often calculated as (Net Profit / Initial Investment) × 100. To get a true ROI, net profit should include all costs: purchase price, fees, taxes, and any other expenses. Excluding costs inflates ROI. Our <a href="/">ROI Calculator</a> uses Final Value − Initial Investment; users should account for fees and taxes separately if they want a fully loaded ROI.</p>

      <h2>Net Profit vs. Other Metrics</h2>
      <p><strong>Gross profit</strong> = Revenue − COGS; excludes operating expenses. <strong><a href="/glossary/ebitda.html">EBITDA</a></strong> = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization; excludes financing and accounting charges. <strong><a href="/glossary/gross-margin.html">Gross margin</a></strong> = Gross profit / Revenue. Net profit is the most comprehensive measure of bottom-line profitability after all expenses.</p>

      <h2>Caveats</h2>
      <p>Net profit can be affected by non-cash items (depreciation, amortization), one-time gains or losses, and accounting choices. For cash-focused analysis, operating cash flow is sometimes preferred. Net profit is reported on an accrual basis; actual cash flow may differ.</p>
