      <h1>Cap Rate vs ROI</h1>

      <p>Cap rate and ROI are both used in real estate but measure different things. Cap rate is an all-cash yield (NOI / value); ROI is the return on a specific investment, often including financing and appreciation. This page covers formulas, a rental example, why cap rate excludes appreciation, and when to use each. See <a href="/glossary/cap-rate.html">cap rate</a>, <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/">Real Estate ROI</a>, and <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/rental-property-roi.html">Rental Property ROI</a> for more.</p>

      <h2>Cap Rate Formula</h2>
      <p class="math-inline">Cap Rate = NOI / Property Value</p>
      <p>NOI (Net Operating Income) is rental income minus operating expenses—property tax, insurance, maintenance, property management, vacancy allowance—before debt service. Property value is typically purchase price or current market value. Cap rate is a snapshot yield: what percentage would the property earn per year if bought all-cash with no financing? It does not include mortgage payments, appreciation, or sale proceeds. See <a href="/glossary/cap-rate.html">cap rate</a> in the glossary.</p>

      <h2>ROI in Real Estate</h2>
      <p>ROI = (Gain − Cost) / Cost × 100. For a rental, gain can be defined as total cash flow over the hold period plus sale proceeds; cost is total investment (purchase, closing, improvements). ROI can be calculated on an all-cash basis or on equity (cash invested) when leveraged. It can include or exclude appreciation depending on whether you use sale price or hold-period cash flow only. So ROI is flexible but must be defined clearly; cap rate is a standardized yield with no financing or appreciation. See <a href="/learn/what-is-roi.html">What Is ROI?</a> and <a href="/">ROI calculator</a>.</p>

      <h2>Rental Example</h2>
      <p>Property value $500,000. NOI = $30,000 per year. Cap rate = 30,000 / 500,000 = 6%. If you buy all-cash, your first-year income return is 6%. If you finance with $100,000 down and $400,000 debt at 5% interest ($20,000/year), cash flow after debt = 30,000 − 20,000 = $10,000. ROI on equity = 10,000 / 100,000 = 10%. So cap rate is 6% and leveraged ROI on equity is 10%. Over 5 years, if you sell for $600,000, total gain = $100,000 appreciation + (5 × $10,000) = $150,000; total ROI on $100,000 invested = 150%. Cap rate does not capture that appreciation or the leverage effect; ROI can.</p>

      <h2>Appreciation Exclusion in Cap Rate</h2>
      <p>Cap rate excludes appreciation by construction: it uses current NOI and current value. It answers "what yield do I get from income today?" ROI over a hold period can include appreciation by using sale price in the gain. So a 5% cap rate property can produce a much higher total ROI if appreciation is strong—or a negative ROI if the market falls. Cap rate is not a predictor of total return; it is a current yield metric. For total return analysis, use ROI (or IRR) over the intended hold. See <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/rental-property-roi.html">Rental Property ROI</a> for modeling both income and appreciation.</p>

      <h2>Comparison Table</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Cap Rate</th><th>ROI</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Formula</td><td>NOI / Value</td><td>(Gain − Cost) / Cost × 100</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Financing</td><td>Excluded (all-cash)</td><td>Included when using equity</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Appreciation</td><td>Excluded</td><td>Included if gain includes sale</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Time horizon</td><td>Snapshot (current)</td><td>Over hold period</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Typical use</td><td>Compare properties, value</td><td>Evaluate specific investment</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Use-Case Scenarios</h2>
      <p><strong>Use cap rate</strong> to compare similar properties on a consistent yield basis, to estimate value (Value = NOI / Cap Rate), or to communicate current income yield. <strong>Use ROI</strong> to evaluate your actual investment including leverage and planned sale, or to compare against other asset classes. The <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/">Real Estate ROI</a> hub and <a href="/comparisons/cash-on-cash-vs-roi.html">Cash-on-Cash vs ROI</a> extend this to cash-on-cash return for leveraged deals.</p>

      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Cap rate and ROI can diverge sharply. A low cap rate property (e.g., 4%) in a strong appreciation market may produce high ROI over time; a high cap rate (e.g., 8%) in a weak market may produce low or negative ROI. Use cap rate for current yield and comparables; use ROI for your specific deal and hold period. See <a href="/glossary/net-profit.html">net profit</a> for accounting context.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>When is cap rate used instead of ROI?</h3>
          <p>Cap rate is used to compare properties on a consistent yield basis. ROI is used to evaluate a specific investment including financing and sale.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can ROI be higher than cap rate?</h3>
          <p>Yes. With leverage, ROI on equity can exceed cap rate. With appreciation, total ROI over a hold can exceed the going-in cap rate.</p>
