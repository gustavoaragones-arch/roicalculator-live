      <h1>ROI vs NPV</h1>
      <div class="definition-block">
        <p><strong>ROI vs NPV:</strong> ROI is a percentage return (gain over cost) and does not discount cash flows. NPV (Net Present Value) is the sum of all cash flows discounted to today at a chosen rate; positive NPV means the project adds value. Use ROI for simple percentage comparison; use NPV when dollar value at cost of capital and reinvestment assumptions matter.</p>

      <p>ROI expresses return as a percentage; NPV (Net Present Value) expresses it in dollars by discounting all cash flows to the present. This page covers the NPV formula, the role of the discount rate, a multi-year example, sensitivity, and when to use each. See <a href="/">ROI calculator</a>, <a href="/learn/what-is-roi.html">What Is ROI?</a>, and <a href="/comparisons/roi-vs-irr.html">ROI vs IRR</a> for related concepts.</p>

      <h2>ROI Formula (Recap)</h2>
      <p class="math-inline">ROI = [(Final Value − Initial Investment) / Initial Investment] × 100</p>
      <p>ROI is a percentage. It does not discount future cash flows. For multi-year projects, <a href="/glossary/annualized-return.html">annualized ROI</a> is often used for comparison.</p>

      <h2>Net Present Value Formula</h2>
      <p>NPV is the sum of all cash flows, each discounted to the present at a rate r (the discount rate):</p>
      <p class="math-inline">NPV = C<sub>0</sub> + C<sub>1</sub>/(1+r) + C<sub>2</sub>/(1+r)<sup>2</sup> + … + C<sub>n</sub>/(1+r)<sup>n</sup></p>
      <p>Outflows (e.g., initial investment) are negative; inflows are positive. NPV is in currency units (e.g., dollars). A positive NPV means the project adds value over and above the cost of capital; negative NPV means it destroys value. Zero NPV means the project just meets the required return. See <a href="/glossary/net-profit.html">net profit</a> for accounting profit; NPV is a cash-flow-based, discounted measure.</p>

      <h2>Discount Rate Explanation</h2>
      <p>The discount rate r represents the opportunity cost of capital: the return that could be earned on an alternative investment of similar risk. It is often set to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), a hurdle rate, or the cost of borrowing. Higher r reduces the present value of future cash flows; lower r increases it. NPV is sensitive to r: a project that is attractive at 8% may have negative NPV at 12%. Sensitivity analysis—recalculating NPV at different rates—is standard practice.</p>

      <h2>Example: Multi-Year Project</h2>
      <p>Project: invest $200,000 today; receive $60,000 at end of years 1–4 and $80,000 at end of year 5. Total nominal inflow = $320,000. Simple ROI could be (320,000 − 200,000) / 200,000 = 60%, but that ignores timing. At 10% discount rate: NPV = −200,000 + 60,000/1.1 + 60,000/1.1² + 60,000/1.1³ + 60,000/1.1⁴ + 80,000/1.1⁵ ≈ −200,000 + 54,545 + 49,587 + 45,079 + 40,981 + 49,674 ≈ $39,866. NPV is positive, so the project adds value at 10%. At 15%, NPV would be lower; at 20%, it could turn negative. IRR is the rate that makes NPV = 0 (here, roughly 17%). So the project is acceptable for any discount rate below that IRR.</p>

      <h2>Sensitivity Discussion</h2>
      <p>NPV is sensitive to the discount rate and to the cash flow estimates. Small changes in r can flip NPV from positive to negative for marginal projects. Similarly, overstating inflows or understating outflows overstates NPV. Best practice is to run base, optimistic, and pessimistic cases for both cash flows and discount rate. ROI does not explicitly show this sensitivity; NPV makes the cost-of-capital assumption transparent.</p>

          <tr><td>Discount rate</td><td>Not used</td><td>Central (r)</td></tr>

      <h2>Use-Case Scenarios</h2>
      <p><strong>Use ROI</strong> when you need a simple, communicable percentage and the investment is a single outlay with a single payoff. <strong>Use NPV</strong> when you need to know whether the project adds value in dollars at your cost of capital, when comparing projects of different size (NPV can be combined with scale), or when the reinvestment rate matters. In corporate finance, NPV is often the primary criterion; ROI is used for reporting and quick checks. See <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/">Real Estate ROI</a> and <a href="/roi-calculator/saas/">SaaS ROI</a> for vertical applications.</p>

      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>ROI answers: what percentage did I make? NPV answers: how much value (in today’s dollars) did this project create? A project can have high ROI but negative NPV if the discount rate is high enough, or positive NPV but modest ROI if the initial investment is large. For capital budgeting, NPV is generally preferred when the goal is to maximize value; ROI is useful for communication and for comparing returns across projects of similar structure.</p>
