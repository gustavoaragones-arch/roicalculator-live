      <h1>Cash-on-Cash vs ROI</h1>

      <p>Cash-on-cash return and ROI are both used in leveraged real estate but answer different questions. Cash-on-cash measures the annual yield on the cash you actually invested (e.g., down payment); ROI can measure total return over a hold period, including appreciation and sale. This page covers leverage, a down payment example, a comparison table, and risk interpretation. See <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/cash-on-cash-return.html">Cash-on-Cash Return</a>, <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/rental-property-roi.html">Rental Property ROI</a>, and <a href="/glossary/">glossary</a> for definitions. <a href="/">ROI calculator</a> and <a href="/learn/what-is-roi.html">What Is ROI?</a> for fundamentals.</p>

      <h2>Leverage Explanation</h2>
      <p>When you finance a property, you invest only a fraction of the purchase price (down payment plus closing and any rehab). The rest is debt. Cash-on-cash return measures the annual pre-tax cash flow (rent minus expenses minus debt service) as a percentage of that cash invested. ROI can be calculated on the same cash (equity) and then gain can include not only cash flow but appreciation and principal paydown at sale. So CoC is an income yield on equity; ROI can be a total return on equity. Leverage amplifies both: a small amount of cash can control a large asset, so the same dollar of cash flow produces a higher percentage return on cash, but leverage also increases risk if values or rent fall. See <a href="/glossary/ltv.html">LTV</a> and <a href="/glossary/net-profit.html">net profit</a> for related concepts.</p>

      <h2>Cash-on-Cash Formula</h2>
      <p class="math-inline">Cash-on-Cash = (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Cash Invested) × 100</p>
      <p>Cash invested = down payment + closing costs + any out-of-pocket improvements. Annual cash flow = rent − operating expenses − debt service. CoC does not include appreciation or sale. See <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/cash-on-cash-return.html">Cash-on-Cash Return</a> calculator.</p>

      <h2>ROI in This Context</h2>
      <p>ROI = (Gain − Cost) / Cost × 100. For a leveraged rental, cost is typically cash invested (same as for CoC). Gain can be (1) total cash flow over the hold period plus sale proceeds minus remaining debt, or (2) total cash flow only (income ROI). When gain includes sale proceeds, ROI captures appreciation and principal paydown; it is a total return. So CoC is a single-period income yield; ROI over N years is total return over N years. See <a href="/learn/roi-formula.html">ROI formula</a>.</p>

      <h2>Down Payment Example</h2>
      <p>Purchase $300,000 with $75,000 down and $225,000 mortgage. Closing $5,000. Cash invested = $80,000. Annual rent $28,000; expenses $9,000; debt service $14,000. Cash flow = 28,000 − 9,000 − 14,000 = $5,000. Cash-on-cash = 5,000 / 80,000 × 100 = 6.25%. Over 5 years, total cash flow = $25,000. If sold for $360,000 with $210,000 left on the loan, equity at sale = $150,000. Total gain = 25,000 + (150,000 − 80,000) = $95,000. ROI = 95,000 / 80,000 × 100 = 118.75%. So CoC is 6.25% (income yield); 5-year ROI is 118.75% (total return including appreciation and paydown). CoC says nothing about that appreciation; ROI does.</p>

      <h2>Comparison Table</h2>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Cash-on-Cash</th><th>ROI</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Period</td><td>Annual (snapshot)</td><td>Over hold period (or annualized)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Includes appreciation</td><td>No</td><td>Yes, if gain includes sale</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Includes principal paydown</td><td>No</td><td>Yes, via equity at sale</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Denominator</td><td>Cash invested</td><td>Cash invested (or total cost)</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Typical use</td><td>Income yield, compare deals</td><td>Total return, exit planning</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Risk Interpretation</h2>
      <p>Relying only on cash-on-cash can be misleading. A property can have high CoC but low or negative total ROI if the market falls and sale proceeds are weak. Conversely, negative or low CoC (e.g., in a growth market where you accept low income for appreciation) can still produce high ROI if appreciation is strong—but that is riskier. Use CoC to assess income yield and compare leveraged deals on a consistent basis; use ROI to assess total return and to stress-test exit scenarios. See <a href="/comparisons/cap-rate-vs-roi.html">Cap Rate vs ROI</a> for the all-cash yield counterpart; <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/">Real Estate ROI</a> for the full framework.</p>

      <h2>Use-Case Scenarios</h2>
      <p><strong>Use cash-on-cash</strong> to compare income yield across leveraged properties, to set minimum yield targets on equity, or when current cash flow is the priority. <strong>Use ROI</strong> to evaluate total return over a planned hold, to compare against other investments, or when exit timing and appreciation matter. The <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/rental-property-roi.html">Rental Property ROI</a> calculator models both income and appreciation; the <a href="/roi-calculator/real-estate/cash-on-cash-return.html">Cash-on-Cash Return</a> calculator focuses on yield.</p>

      <h2>Interpretation</h2>
      <p>CoC and ROI complement each other. CoC answers "what yield am I getting on my cash from income?" ROI answers "what total return did I get (or will I get) including sale?" For stable income-focused investors, CoC may dominate; for those who care about total wealth impact and exit, ROI is essential. Do not assume high CoC implies high ROI—or the reverse—without modeling the full hold period.</p>

      <div class="faq-list">
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What is cash-on-cash return?</h3>
          <p>Cash-on-cash = (Annual Pre-Tax Cash Flow / Cash Invested) × 100. It measures yield on the cash you put in, not the full property value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does leverage affect cash-on-cash vs ROI?</h3>
          <p>Leverage reduces cash invested, so the same cash flow can produce higher CoC. Total ROI over a hold includes appreciation and can be higher or lower than CoC.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does cash-on-cash include appreciation?</h3>
          <p>No. CoC is an annual income yield. ROI can include appreciation when gain includes sale proceeds.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>When is cash-on-cash preferred to ROI?</h3>
          <p>When comparing income yield on equity across leveraged deals, or when current cash flow is the priority over total return.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What are the risks of relying only on cash-on-cash?</h3>
          <p>CoC ignores appreciation, principal paydown, and sale. High CoC can coincide with low total ROI if values fall; low CoC can coincide with high ROI if appreciation is strong but riskier.</p>
