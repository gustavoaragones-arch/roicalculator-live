      <h2>What Is ROI?</h2>
      <p>Return on investment (ROI) is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency or profitability of an investment. It expresses the gain or loss generated relative to the amount of money invested. ROI is widely used in finance, real estate, marketing, and business planning because it provides a simple, comparable metric across different types of investments.</p>

      <h3>The ROI Formula</h3>
      <p>The standard ROI formula is:</p>
      <p class="math-inline">ROI = [(Final Value − Initial Investment) / Initial Investment] × 100</p>
      <p>In notation: ROI = [(V<sub>f</sub> − I) / I] × 100%, where V<sub>f</sub> is the final value and I is the initial investment. A positive ROI indicates a profit; a negative ROI indicates a loss. For example, an investment of $10,000 that grows to $15,000 has an ROI of 50%.</p>

      <h3>Step-by-Step Example</h3>
      <p>Suppose you invest $20,000 in a stock. After three years, you sell for $28,000.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Identify initial investment: $20,000</li>
        <li>Identify final value: $28,000</li>
        <li>Calculate gain: $28,000 − $20,000 = $8,000</li>
        <li>Divide gain by initial investment: $8,000 / $20,000 = 0.40</li>
        <li>Multiply by 100: 0.40 × 100 = 40% ROI</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Your total ROI over three years is 40%. This does not tell you the annual rate of return—for that, you need annualized ROI.</p>

      <h3>Annualized ROI Explanation</h3>
      <p>Simple ROI ignores the holding period. A 50% return over one year is not equivalent to a 50% return over ten years. Annualized ROI converts the total return into an equivalent compound annual growth rate:</p>
      <p class="math-inline">Annualized ROI = [(Final Value / Initial Investment)<sup>1/n</sup> − 1] × 100</p>
      <p>where n is the number of years. For the $20,000 → $28,000 example over 3 years: (28,000/20,000)^(1/3) − 1 ≈ 0.119, or about 11.9% per year. This allows meaningful comparison between investments with different time horizons.</p>

      <h3>When ROI Can Be Misleading</h3>
      <p>ROI has several limitations. It does not account for the time value of money—$100 today is worth more than $100 in five years. It often excludes transaction costs, taxes, and ongoing fees, which can significantly reduce actual returns. ROI can also be manipulated by choosing selective time periods or including only favorable costs. When comparing investments, risk is not factored in: a 30% ROI on a high-risk venture is not equivalent to 30% on a government bond. For cash flows occurring at different times, <a href="/learn/roi-vs-irr.html">IRR</a> or net present value (NPV) are more appropriate.</p>

      <h3>ROI vs IRR</h3>
      <p>IRR (Internal Rate of Return) addresses one of ROI’s main weaknesses: the timing of cash flows. ROI treats all dollars equally regardless of when they occur. IRR solves for the discount rate that makes the net present value of all cash flows equal to zero. For a single lump-sum investment and return, ROI and IRR tell similar stories. For projects with multiple inflows and outflows—such as real estate with rental income and renovations—IRR provides a more accurate picture. See <a href="/learn/roi-vs-irr.html">ROI vs IRR</a> for a detailed comparison.</p>

      <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Comparing ROI across different time periods without annualizing</li>
        <li>Ignoring fees, taxes, and transaction costs</li>
        <li>Using ROI for investments with irregular cash flows instead of IRR</li>
        <li>Confusing gross and net returns—ensure all costs are included</li>
        <li>Extrapolating past performance as a guarantee of future results</li>
      </ul>
